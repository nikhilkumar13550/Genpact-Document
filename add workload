Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
3 minutes 22 seconds3:22
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 3 minutes 22 seconds
So this is the site for um amendment logs.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 3 minutes 30 seconds
It's loading.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 3 minutes 35 seconds
So from here we're gonna generate the report. So this is this part. So RDB coding, then we're gonna select the log status, so so only two statuses.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 3 minutes 58 seconds
OK, so reports.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 4 minutes 12 seconds
Then RDB coding. So for this filters we're just gonna take off 2 filters. So the log status is amendment complete. So the other one is the OA status.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 4 minutes 28 seconds
I'm gonna select in progress then run report so it will generate a report that captures all amendment completed logs with in progress.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 4 minutes 45 seconds
Status. Then it will. Sometimes it takes a while to generate a report, so let's just use this one.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 4 minutes 58 seconds
So it will generate a file and we're just gonna download it through Excel, then save the Excel file here.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 5 minutes 12 seconds
At the shared folder.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 5 minutes 16 seconds
Then let's use the recent one.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 5 minutes 23 seconds
So this one I generated last.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 5 minutes 28 seconds
Uh, Wednesday.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 5 minutes 51 seconds
OK, so.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 5 minutes 55 seconds
Mhm.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 6 minutes
So once the Excel file is saved on the shared folder, it contains three tabs, so the summary that with summary and that with details. So I just added this last tab which is assigned to RSS or to the team.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 6 minutes 20 seconds
It's so loud.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 6 minutes 25 seconds
So for these three tabs, we're just gonna use the that with details.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 6 minutes 38 seconds
Sorry, my laptop is so slow. I'm about to replace it tomorrow.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 6 minutes 54 seconds
Oh.

Ron Allan Lustre
7 minutes 7 seconds7:07
Ron Allan Lustre 7 minutes 7 seconds
Sheila, while it's still loading, yeah, for the first three tabs you haven't edited anything on this yet. This is how it looks like once downloaded from AIM site.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
7 minutes 7 seconds7:07
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 7 minutes 7 seconds
OK.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 7 minutes 11 seconds
Mhm.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 7 minutes 15 seconds
Yes, so.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 7 minutes 22 seconds
Yes, it's the raw data. Yeah, so this is what it looks like. Yeah, OK, so so it's such a large file, so not all information here are usable or.

Ron Allan Lustre
7 minutes 25 seconds7:25
Ron Allan Lustre 7 minutes 25 seconds
OK. It's pretty. Thank you.

Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
7 minutes 40 seconds7:40
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 7 minutes 40 seconds
Or just just need it. So there's a lot of repeated log number for each entry. I'm just gonna scroll it up.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 7 minutes 54 seconds
So from this uh that with details tab.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 7 minutes 59 seconds
What we just need is the first the segment. So we're just gonna use the mid market, small business and small signatures. So we're not gonna, we don't need the corporate one.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 8 minutes 13 seconds
Then on the last column.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 8 minutes 20 seconds
So this is like the amendment details or the changes to the plan. So there's a lot like this one termi terminate or adding a new Uh benefit or class.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 8 minutes 37 seconds
So from this column we basically remove the plan sponsor. So there's a lot of terminating plan sponsor which we don't use or just gonna fill up our file.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 8 minutes 58 seconds
So plan sponsor.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 9 minutes 4 seconds
Oops.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 9 minutes 11 seconds
So this is what we do before the manual filtering. So we remove the plant sponsor first.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 9 minutes 20 seconds
Then once it's, uh, removed.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 9 minutes 25 seconds
We're we're gonna go back to the first columns.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 9 minutes 32 seconds
Uh, it's also.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 9 minutes 44 seconds
OK. And from here we're gonna unselect the corporate segment.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 10 minutes 8 seconds
OK.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 10 minutes 14 seconds
Then.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 10 minutes 19 seconds
We're gonna copy it all.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 10 minutes 24 seconds
And paste it in the new tab.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 10 minutes 46 seconds
So from this tab I'm just gonna paste value.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 10 minutes 54 seconds
Danish.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 11 minutes 1 second
And from here we're gonna remove the duplicate log number.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 11 minutes 9 seconds
Yes.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 11 minutes 10 seconds
Actually I'm already using like an Excel file.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 11 minutes 18 seconds
That I just made last year to simplify this process. So we're not doing this manual filtering anymore, so it will clean up the file for me.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 11 minutes 36 seconds
OK, add the.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 11 minutes 40 seconds
Then remove duplicates.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 11 minutes 44 seconds
Remove duplicates and select then log number.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 11 minutes 55 seconds
OK.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 12 minutes 1 second
And there's still a lot, so 1744 unique value streaming.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 12 minutes 8 seconds
OK.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 12 minutes 10 seconds
So from this file, we're just gonna select the renewal date that we need. For example, for June renewal, we're just gonna use the six months prior from June, which is January to June.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 12 minutes 29 seconds
So all the remaining months are we're gonna remove that from the file.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 12 minutes 40 seconds
So for example, this I'm just gonna deselect, uh, all the months from July to December.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 12 minutes 51 seconds
So I'll just need the January to June for the June renewal.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 13 minutes
Oh yeah.
Sharma, Ajay
13 minutes 9 seconds13:09
Sharma, Ajay 13 minutes 9 seconds
So you need only from Jan to June of 2026 and 2026.

Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
13 minutes 14 seconds13:14
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 13 minutes 14 seconds
January to June.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 13 minutes 17 seconds
Uh, uh, it doesn't matter what year. We're just covering all the Uh year for that month, yes.
SA
Sharma, Ajay
13 minutes 23 seconds13:23
Sharma, Ajay 13 minutes 23 seconds
OK.

Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
13 minutes 28 seconds13:28
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 13 minutes 28 seconds
OK.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 13 minutes 31 seconds
And so this is all the data that we need. So all the plan sponsor are being removed or corporate segments are being removed then.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 13 minutes 47 seconds
All of the duplicate log number are removed. Then from there we're just gonna select the month that we need, the months that we need, which is 6 months. So if we're working on June renewal, we need six months prior.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 14 minutes 6 seconds
From that month, so from June backwards, which is covers January to June, then for July, February to July, so so on and so forth and once all the data.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 14 minutes 22 seconds
Or what we call this clean sheet. So once it's clean, we're just gonna select the log number, the renewal date and the segment and then assigned it to the team so it will look like this.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 14 minutes 40 seconds
So this one is few because I just selected the specific month so which is June.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 14 minutes 50 seconds
But for first assignment, we're gonna select the renewal date, the segment and the log number, yes
Sharma, Ajay
14 minutes 58 seconds14:58
Sharma, Ajay 14 minutes 58 seconds
Oh, uh, sorry, sorry, Sheila.
Sharma, Ajay 15 minutes 1 second
One question, could you please explain this logic of renewal date again like what which months we are selecting?

Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
15 minutes 3 seconds15:03
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 15 minutes 3 seconds
Mhm.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 15 minutes 11 seconds
Oh, every month we're working for a renewal. So every month there's a renewal happening. So for example, this this February, June renewals are happening, which is.
SA
Sharma, Ajay
15 minutes 21 seconds15:21
Sharma, Ajay 15 minutes 21 seconds
Right.

Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
15 minutes 31 seconds15:31
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 15 minutes 31 seconds
That's Friday. So, so monthly when we're generating aim logs, we capture not just the specific renewal for that one, so we're backtracking.
SA
Sharma, Ajay
15 minutes 32 seconds15:32
Sharma, Ajay 15 minutes 32 seconds
Mhm.

Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
15 minutes 46 seconds15:46
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 15 minutes 46 seconds
Six months prior or five months prior to make sure all the amendments for that renewal has been completed. So all the renewals are run smoothly for that, for example.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 16 minutes 3 seconds
After this call I.
SA
Sharma, Ajay
16 minutes 3 seconds16:03
Sharma, Ajay 16 minutes 3 seconds
Yeah, let let's take, yeah, let let's take February as example like we are doing a renewal in February. So which all renewal date are we going to select?

Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
16 minutes 13 seconds16:13
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 16 minutes 13 seconds
OK, for for example, this February, so since the June renewal already run last Friday, so from this date until March or first week of March, we're gonna do.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 16 minutes 31 seconds
July renewal. So for July renewal, we're not just gonna select the July month for this file, so we're gonna select February to July. So let's do that.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 16 minutes 49 seconds
So yes, regardless of the year.
Sharma, Ajay
16 minutes 52 seconds16:52
Sharma, Ajay 16 minutes 52 seconds
Regardless of the year, right?

Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
17 minutes 4 seconds17:04
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 17 minutes 4 seconds
So the logic behind that is we need to make sure that all, sorry, all the codings before July month has been completed. So all July renewals rates are.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 17 minutes 22 seconds
Uh, perfectly aligned.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 17 minutes 26 seconds
Uh huh. So February to.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 17 minutes 30 seconds
July.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 17 minutes 38 seconds
So there's like a lot of manual uh uh process as you can see.
KN
Kumar, Nikhil
17 minutes 40 seconds17:40
Kumar, Nikhil 17 minutes 40 seconds
Yeah.

Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
17 minutes 49 seconds17:49
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 17 minutes 49 seconds
So February, March.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 17 minutes 56 seconds
I think that's it.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 18 minutes 3 seconds
So for this we have.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 18 minutes 8 seconds
479 log number. So we're just gonna assign this to the team, but not all this details, only the log number, the renewal date and the segment.
SA
Sharma, Ajay
18 minutes 12 seconds18:12
Sharma, Ajay 18 minutes 12 seconds
Yeah.
Sharma, Ajay 18 minutes 22 seconds
OK, OK.

Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
18 minutes 22 seconds18:22
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 18 minutes 22 seconds
Yeah.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 18 minutes 24 seconds
Then I just gonna copy it, then paste it on a different Excel file.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 18 minutes 31 seconds
Which is our workload tracker.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 18 minutes 36 seconds
So this one.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 18 minutes 45 seconds
Yeah, so from that aim report files or just gonna need the renewal date, the segment and the log number, then we're just gonna work on this file after assign.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 18 minutes 59 seconds
Yeah, so that's it. So the tricky part from this is like the filtering, yeah.
Sharma, Ajay
19 minutes 4 seconds19:04
Sharma, Ajay 19 minutes 4 seconds
No, just go just yeah. So after you have pasted all the data into the next sheet assigned to RSS, yeah.

Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
19 minutes 12 seconds19:12
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 19 minutes 12 seconds
Yes, I'll just copy it, then I'll paste it here so we just know what we've what we've just assigned since not all the data here.
SA
Sharma, Ajay
19 minutes 22 seconds19:22
Sharma, Ajay 19 minutes 22 seconds
Mhm.

Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
19 minutes 28 seconds19:28
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 19 minutes 28 seconds
Are to be assigned to the team, yes.
SA
Sharma, Ajay
19 minutes 30 seconds19:30
Sharma, Ajay 19 minutes 30 seconds
Required. Yeah, yeah yeah. So so all the filter data then are you copying it somewhere else apart from assigning into RSS or just you paste it in the in the next sheet and that's the process completed.
KN
Kumar, Nikhil
19 minutes 34 seconds19:34
Kumar, Nikhil 19 minutes 34 seconds
It.

Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
19 minutes 47 seconds19:47

Yes, I'll just paste it here. Then from here I'll just copy and paste it on the workload data that I've just shown you and then that's it after that.

Sharma, Ajay 20 minutes 18 seconds
Here. OK, yeah, OK, so you just paste the renewal date, segment and log number and the rest of the columns which are there. Yeah, ABFGH. So whosoever is working on it, he will update it, right?

Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
20 minutes 19 seconds20:19

Oops, So what just what I just did here. It's like a.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 22 minutes 24 seconds
From the top with details, yeah, so from here that with details was I generated the report. So the raw data I just copy from.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 22 minutes 40 seconds
All the details, but uh, not including the first column or the header. So I just copy it, then yeah, paste it here. Then once I uh.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 22 minutes 55 seconds
Click the clean sheet button so it removes all the plan sponsor, it removes all the duplicate log number here and it removes all the corporate segment.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 23 minutes 10 seconds
Then once I click the run.

Um.

Yeah, it will show me like enter the renewal month, correct, for example July.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 23 minutes 28 seconds
So it will filter the month or like that deleted those outside the ring February to July inclusive. So this is like a clean file already. So when I click the prepare data.
