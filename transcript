And on the MMRT, which is the last, the last step that we're using, let's just go into open this file.
Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 14 minutes 22 seconds
We also have sample of folder on this, so I'm like I'll just go to open first the sample reports that we're using. So for this one because there's a little multiple categories.
Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 14 minutes 40 seconds
That that we are using as well. So oh sorry, this is for notepad. So we're just going to download.
Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 14 minutes 54 seconds
OK.
Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 14 minutes 56 seconds
Yes, sorry. We're just going to download the if only if they have the the benefits like for example for this they only have life benefits, they only have long-term disability benefits.
Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 15 minutes 13 seconds
And then for health and dental, it was already included in the rate summary and also in this is like the like all category.
Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 15 minutes 28 seconds
Report. So let's just open this and.
Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 15 minutes 34 seconds
Put it in here. Sorry.
Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 15 minutes 37 seconds
All right. So for this one, this is like the sample report that we're going to have like this is all for this all for Class A. This is the amount like the salary that they have including including the life benefits, accidental benefits.
Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 15 minutes 56 seconds
Long term visibility and then for health this is like the counts that they have and then and then for for the report this is the.
Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 16 minutes 12 seconds

Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 16 minutes 52 seconds
Numbers in here. Usually if we're going to download this MRT report, these were all blank and we have to input the amounts manually.
Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 17 minutes 6 seconds
So if I'm just going to open this one is for example for for life benefit.
Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 17 minutes 18 seconds
So these are like the total amount and then this is the OR they are categorized for male and female employees. So for this one we're going to input those in here.
Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 17 minutes 34 seconds
