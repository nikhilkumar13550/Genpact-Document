This is SA data manipulation and SA data MRP completion. So basically we want to see the end to end process and.
Ron Allan Lustre 0 minutes 19 seconds
The tools and systems being used, if there are templates how to fill that out and like basically when you do like copy paste how you're doing it from.
Ron Allan Lustre 0 minutes 34 seconds
One system to another. So that's uh basically the goal for this uh session.

Yes.

Carlo James Caguiat Blacano
1 minute 2 seconds1:02
Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 1 minute 2 seconds
All right. So yeah, as you know, we may not going to be able to use a live account. So we prepared some datas that similar to the one that we're using and.
Sharma, Ajay 27 minutes 2 seconds
OK, OK.
Sharma, Ajay 27 minutes 5 seconds
Fine.

Carlo James Caguiat Blacano
27 minutes 5 seconds27:05
Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 27 minutes 5 seconds
Yeah, it depends.
Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 27 minutes 10 seconds
Also like for example, there are times well that we we have like there are certain months that they don't have any pricing changes. So we are allowed to download everything like download the reports. However there is a certain week that we have.
Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 27 minutes 30 seconds
Wait for the Um.
Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 27 minutes 35 seconds
For the for the Renewal report to to be done before doing the coding in mainframe.
SA
Sharma, Ajay
27 minutes 50 seconds27:50
Sharma, Ajay 27 minutes 50 seconds
OK.
Sharma, Ajay 27 minutes 57 seconds
So this was the complete process.

Carlo James Caguiat Blacano
27 minutes 59 seconds27:59
Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 27 minutes 59 seconds
Yeah, that is the complete process that we do. There are other employees like if they have like for example for if they have like multiple employees like such as 200 employees and more, there are certain reports.
SA
Sharma, Ajay
28 minutes 1 second28:01
Sharma, Ajay 28 minutes 1 second
OK.
Sharma, Ajay 28 minutes 3 seconds
Hmm.

Carlo James Caguiat Blacano

Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 28 minutes 19 seconds
That they need to do.
SA
Sharma, Ajay
28 minutes 23 seconds28:23
Sharma, Ajay 28 minutes 23 seconds
OK, so there is an exception after a limit of how many employees are there in the company. So if more than 200 then there are certain extra steps that we need to perform.

Carlo James Caguiat Blacano
28 minutes 25 seconds28:25
Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 28 minutes 25 seconds
Yeah.
Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 28 minutes 31 seconds

Carlo James Caguiat Blacano
28 minutes 58 seconds28:58
Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 28 minutes 58 seconds
Mhm.
Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 29 minutes 6 seconds
For like there is like like like we're doing the data manipulation on the first week. Sometimes we do the the merit download reports on the second week of the month and then we're doing the coding.
Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 29 minutes 26 seconds
On the third week of the month that that is the safe days to do those and then for the last month that is where we do the MRT updates or MRT reports.

Ron Allan Lustre
29 minutes 30 seconds29:30
Ron Allan Lustre 29 minutes 30 seconds
OK.

Carlo James Caguiat Blacano
29 minutes 43 seconds29:43
Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 29 minutes 43 seconds
And it was continuous, yeah, for like after doing the MRT, sometimes we are already receiving the the drafts for the next month and that's going to be.
Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 29 minutes 59 seconds
That's the time that we're going to do the data manipulation again.

Ron Allan Lustre
30 minutes 7 seconds30:07
Ron Allan Lustre 30 minutes 7 seconds
OK, so seems like a weekly task for the app for week period to complete the end to end process for getting a new request. OK.

Ron Allan Lustre 0 minutes 3 seconds
Are like raw data? Where is this coming from? If you're doing like a copy paste of information, what are the sources? So we want to know all the tools or applications being used on this process.

Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
0 minutes 13 seconds0:13
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 0 minutes 13 seconds
OK.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 0 minutes 13 seconds
OK.

Ron Allan Lustre
0 minutes 21 seconds0:21
Ron Allan Lustre 0 minutes 21 seconds
Anything to add, Ajay, uh, before we start?

Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
0 minutes 22 seconds0:22
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 0 minutes 22 seconds
OK, sure.

Ron Allan Lustre
0 minutes 28 seconds0:28
Ron Allan Lustre 0 minutes 28 seconds
OK. Yeah. If you're ready, uh, Sheila, please proceed. You can share your screen. Thank you.
SA

Sharma, Ajay
0 minutes 30 seconds0:30
Sharma, Ajay 0 minutes 30 seconds
Oh, let's start.

Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
0 minutes 32 seconds0:32
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 0 minutes 32 seconds
OK, I'll share my screen.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 0 minutes 43 seconds
Sweet Anilette.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 1 minute 8 seconds
Just give me one second. I'm trying to share my screen but.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 6 minutes 54 seconds
Oh.

Ron Allan Lustre
7 minutes 7 seconds7:07
Ron Allan Lustre 7 minutes 7 seconds
Sheila, while it's still loading, yeah, for the first three tabs you haven't edited anything on this yet. This is how it looks like once downloaded from AIM site.

Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
7 minutes 7 seconds7:07
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 7 minutes 7 seconds
OK.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 7 minutes 11 seconds
Mhm.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 7 minutes 15 seconds
Yes, so.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 7 minutes 22 seconds
Yes, it's the raw data. Yeah, so this is what it looks like. Yeah, OK, so so it's such a large file, so not all information here are usable or.

Ron Allan Lustre
7 minutes 25 seconds7:25
Ron Allan Lustre 7 minutes 25 seconds
OK. It's pretty. Thank you.

Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
7 minutes 40 seconds7:40
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 7 minutes 40 seconds
Or just just need it. So there's a lot of repeated log number for each entry. I'm just gonna scroll it up.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 7 minutes 54 seconds
So from this uh that with details tab.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 7 minutes 59 seconds
What we just need is the first the segment. So we're just gonna use the mid market, small business and small signatures. So we're not gonna, we don't need the corporate one.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 8 minutes 13 seconds
Then on the last column.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 11 minutes 55 seconds
OK.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 12 minutes 1 second
And there's still a lot, so 1744 unique value streaming.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 12 minutes 8 seconds
OK.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 12 minutes 10 seconds
So from this file, we're just gonna select the renewal date that we need. For example, for June renewal, we're just gonna use the six months prior from June, which is January to June.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 12 minutes 29 seconds
So all the remaining months are we're gonna remove that from the file.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 12 minutes 40 seconds
So for example, this I'm just gonna deselect, uh, all the months from July to December.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 12 minutes 51 seconds
So I'll just need the January to June for the June renewal.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 13 minutes
Oh yeah.
SA
Sharma, Ajay
13 minutes 9 seconds13:09
Sharma, Ajay 13 minutes 9 seconds
So you need only from Jan to June of 2026 and 2026.

Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
13 minutes 14 seconds13:14
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 13 minutes 14 seconds
January to June.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 13 minutes 17 seconds
Uh, uh, it doesn't matter what year. We're just covering all the Uh year for that month, yes.
SA
Sharma, Ajay
13 minutes 23 seconds13:23
Sharma, Ajay 13 minutes 23 seconds
OK.

Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
13 minutes 28 seconds13:28
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 13 minutes 28 seconds
OK.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 13 minutes 31 seconds
And so this is all the data that we need. So all the plan sponsor are being removed or corporate segments are being removed then.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 13 minutes 47 seconds
All of the duplicate log number are removed. Then from there we're just gonna select the month that we need, the months that we need, which is 6 months. So if we're working on June renewal, we need six months prior.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 14 minutes 6 seconds
From that month, so from June backwards, which is covers January to June, then for July, February to July, so so on and so forth and once all the data.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 14 minutes 22 seconds
Or what we call this clean sheet. So once it's clean, we're just gonna select the log number, the renewal date and the segment and then assigned it to the team so it will look like this.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 14 minutes 40 seconds
So this one is few because I just selected the specific month so which is June.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 14 minutes 50 seconds
But for first assignment, we're gonna select the renewal date, the segment and the log number, yes.
SA
Sharma, Ajay
14 minutes 58 seconds14:58
Sharma, Ajay 14 minutes 58 seconds
Oh, uh, sorry, sorry, Sheila.
Sharma, Ajay 15 minutes 1 second
One question, could you please explain this logic of renewal date again like what which months we are selecting?

Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
15 minutes 3 seconds15:03
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 15 minutes 3 seconds
Mhm.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 15 minutes 11 seconds
Oh, every month we're working for a renewal. So every month there's a renewal happening. So for example, this this February, June renewals are happening, which is.
SA
Sharma, Ajay
15 minutes 21 seconds15:21
Sharma, Ajay 15 minutes 21 seconds
Right.

Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
15 minutes 31 seconds15:31
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 15 minutes 31 seconds
That's Friday. So, so monthly when we're generating aim logs, we capture not just the specific renewal for that one, so we're backtracking.
SA
Sharma, Ajay
15 minutes 32 seconds15:32
Sharma, Ajay 15 minutes 32 seconds
Mhm.

Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
15 minutes 46 seconds15:46
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 15 minutes 46 seconds
Six months prior or five months prior to make sure all the amendments for that renewal has been completed. So all the renewals are run smoothly for that, for example.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 16 minutes 3 seconds
After this call I.
SA
Sharma, Ajay
16 minutes 3 seconds16:03
Sharma, Ajay 16 minutes 3 seconds
Yeah, let let's take, yeah, let let's take February as example like we are doing a renewal in February. So which all renewal date are we going to select?

Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
16 minutes 13 seconds16:13
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 16 minutes 13 seconds
OK, for for example, this February, so since the June renewal already run last Friday, so from this date until March or first week of March, we're gonna do.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 16 minutes 31 seconds
July renewal. So for July renewal, we're not just gonna select the July month for this file, so we're gonna select February to July. So let's do that.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 16 minutes 49 seconds
So yes, regardless of the year.
SA
Sharma, Ajay
16 minutes 52 seconds16:52
Sharma, Ajay 16 minutes 52 seconds
Regardless of the year, right?

Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
17 minutes 4 seconds17:04
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 17 minutes 4 seconds
So the logic behind that is we need to make sure that all, sorry, all the codings before July month has been completed. So all July renewals rates are.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 17 minutes 22 seconds
Uh, perfectly aligned.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 17 minutes 26 seconds
Uh huh. So February to.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 17 minutes 30 seconds
July.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 17 minutes 38 seconds
So there's like a lot of manual uh uh process as you can see.
KN
Kumar, Nikhil
17 minutes 40 seconds17:40
Kumar, Nikhil 17 minutes 40 seconds
Yeah.

Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores
17 minutes 49 seconds17:49
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 17 minutes 49 seconds
So February, March.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 17 minutes 56 seconds
I think that's it.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 18 minutes 3 seconds
So for this we have.
Shiela Marie Aristoteles Flores 18 minutes 8 seconds
479 log number. So we're just gonna assign this to the team, but not all this details, only the log number, the renewal date and the segment.
SA
Sharma, Ajay
18 minutes 12 seconds18:12
Sharma, Ajay 18 minutes 12 seconds
Yeah.
