For like there is like like like we're doing the data manipulation on the first week. Sometimes we do the the merit download reports on the second week of the month and then we're doing the coding.
Carlo James Caguiat Blacano 29 minutes 26 seconds
On the third week of the month that that is the safe days to do those and then for the last month that is where we do the MRT updates or MRT reports.

Ron Allan Lustre
29 minutes 30 seconds29:30
