Then in mailing room this is the process like first of all they handle the mail then clipping the e-mail or document and they scanned. So you know after they scanning the workflow into indexing team and then indexing team identify the request and according to the request they you know index the work type in that respective queue. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:27 
OK, OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:28 
So that's how we received the work. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:31 
So in indexing, there is no data entry being happening for the agent, right? It's just, yeah, it's. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:36 
No, there is no data entry. They are simply no identifying the request and they are indexing an RQ.

OK, understood. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   2:10 
Let me this is our workflow and let me show you the admin system. First of all, let me you know share the app wall application. This is the performing plus which is the admin system for us where we will create the database for this agent. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   2:23 
And the same we use when we were coding the policy, right? Yeah, OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   2:26 
Doing the yes, we verify and we find the agent in this admin system. OK and there is another supporting application. This is a seagull which we use. You know this is a e-mail notification tool where if I you know we need to send any notification, we use this tool to send any kind of notification to the agent or top level. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   2:29 
Yeah. OK. OK. 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   2:48 
OK. 
OK, now let me pull the paperwork. 
So. 
In this request, basically we received the attachment where we received our request. First of all, we have to lock it. 
Then I will open this document view document. 
Here I have to identify the paperwork. So this is the cover page where they mentioned that please appoint this agent as per the required form that is in the file and the requested state is UT. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   3:29 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   3:31 
And I'll so the ADS page, the ADS form will have a nine page basically. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   3:37 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   3:37 
OK, we have, we can have multiple, you know more than 9 pages, but we required 9 page, all nine page. So this is our first page. 
Which is the hierarchy page where you know they mentioned who will be the agent, what will be the Commission percentage and to whom they will report. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   3:48 
OK. 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   3:59 
OK, so here the agency, I'll discuss this one. So basically the agency and their report the SSN for them and they are reporting to the I group. This is the broker dealer for them and the Commission schedule here PL006. I need it. 
And one the signature of the top level. 
These are the basic word for it. Yes, we will. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   4:21 
OK, do we? Yeah. Do we compare this signature with sub? 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   4:29 
We will. I need to know cross, cross validate whether these signs are valid or not to accept the request. 
OK, the second page we will have the you know producer basic information where we will have the agent name, NPN, date of birth and you know state residence address, business address and contact information. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   4:39 
Yeah. 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   4:58 
And on the second page we will have the you know information for their form. So basically Ajay in the appointment we receive two type of request. One is individual, we know where he will report to the top line or intermediate person and the 2nd is officer entity case. 
So basically what is the different between officer entity case and individual? In the officer entity case, what they do, they, you know, open their own forms. 
And work under with no Commission. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   5:34 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   5:34 
So what happened here? The oil Commission will go to the, you know, company's account and they will agent will work on no big Commission. So you know the tax they've they save their tax basically. 
So they open their own pumps. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   5:48 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   5:51 
In this request we have received the office entity case, so where you know we have to create two different different files for them, one for their forms and one for the agent itself. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   6:02 
OK, how did we identify if the second page is filled then? 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   6:05 
So there is a on the first page if you can see oh sorry, on the second page there is a section individual and office of principal. So they check the office of principal. In this case I need to create two different different files. One is for their form and one is for the agent. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   6:11 
OK, individual. OK, OK. 
OK, if it would be the individual, then only one we need to create them. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   6:26 
Or only one file I need to create. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   6:29 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   6:32 
So here if this case is office entity, so I need the information for the form like his entity name, NPN and address. We have all information and in the third section I need the SSN for both of them, the individual SSN. 
I can you highlight too, you know one this will work SSN for both. Oh sorry. 
And this is the corporation and this is individual one. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   7:01 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   7:02 
I have all the information and in this section they mentioned the state in which they want to appoint either the you know they will mention on the cover page or we we can check from this section as well. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   7:12 
OK, so let's say if the cover page is missing, do we get all the information that is required on this ADS sheet? OK, so in. OK, OK, understood. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   7:21 
Yes. 
The cloud page is not required. We just need only 9 pages. These 9 pages. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   7:28 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   7:32 
Moving to the next, this is the business practice questions. We have 10 questions here. We need the answer. Either it should be yes or no. It cannot be blank. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   7:45 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   7:46 
OK. If these are all new, then you know the paperwork, we can complete the setup. If there is someone question which is marked as here, yes, then there is a different procedure which we have to follow. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   7:58 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   7:59 
Yeah. 
We'll discuss it definitely. Then these section we know we provide the blank for them. Like if they marked any question as a yes, then they can provide the explanation what you know what was happened so they can provide the explanation. It's not mandate. They need to fill in this section. They can, you know also attach a separate paperwork for the explanation. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   8:12 
Mm-hmm. OK. OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   8:19 
But in this form we have the sections. If they want then they can provide the explanation in this section. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   8:28 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   8:31 
Moving to the next anti money laundering training. So we're here in this page we received the training information. There's a anti money laundering. It is not required for the broad market but if they have given then we can update. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   8:47 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   8:50 
And one more thing, if they pick on this section then there is a, you know we have to send a template for them. So basically if they check, check this portion, that means they want you know enrollment for form for this training. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   9:08 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   9:08 
So we have a template which we need to send to them so they can, you know, register for their training and they can complete the training. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   9:16 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   9:22 
OK, the next page is for declaration and authorization page where we required the signature of the agent and date and it should be within six month. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   9:33 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   9:34 
Next we have a FCRA pitch, Fair Credit Reporting Act. In this section we require the sign and date both. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   9:43 
Mm-hmm. OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   9:44 
And it should also be a within six month. 
Then the next page is the direct report just where we received the agent bank information in this section agent of bank information. So here what we need, we need the routing number, account number. 
Number name of the account holder name sign. 
Sign, date and SSN. 
These all are the mandate fields for the CFT. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   10:14 
Mhm. 
OK, OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   10:17 
OK, so OK the next the default these are all 9 page we required. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   10:25 
Mhm. 
And there is some of the other information that is required from all the pages, right? 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   10:27 
What? 
Sorry, can you please repeat? 

 
Sharma, Ajay   10:32 
There is, yeah, there is one or the other information, like all the 9 fields are for mandatory for us to check whether the information is there or not. OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   10:39 
Yes. 
OK now I need to just cross validate few things. The first would be the signature on their archive page. It should sign by the top level officer owner of the top level. So what I have to do I have to so you know if the code is starting with P that's mean this is the code code for top level or a broker dealer. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   11:05 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   11:05 
So I know this is the top level. I'll I will open the top level record here is 0028 producer. 
We have already reviewed the function of people. Do you need? Do I need to explain it again? If you want then I can OK. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   11:23 
No, just show me. Just show me where is the signature that you validated. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   11:27 
OK, so first of all you know before validating I need to check the level of this top level. So in the hierarchy tab I need to check it should be level 15. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   11:40 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   11:40 
OK. And if there is, you know, less than level 13, then you know I need to check whether it should be on level 13 or 11. Then there is a, you know, exception. I need to check the notes for this top level, you know, to whom they give the authorization, you know or you know. 
Power power to sign the form. So basically the some top levels has you know sub offices. So what we do what they do the agent are directly not reporting the top level what they do they report to the sub offices so which is which should be on level 13 or 11. So if there is a case where. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   12:07 
OK. 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   12:18 
Where we have the level 13 or 11 on the hierarchy, then we need to check the notes of level 15 to whom they have authorized to, you know, sign the paperwork. 
OK, so in this case we have only level 15. So I'll go to the notes. First of all, in the notes in the Commission tab, I'll get the officer name here. So the officer is Jennifer Earl. So this is the authorized person who can sign this paperwork. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   12:30 
OK, OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   12:52 
So if you can see it's signed by the Jennifer, I can, you know, see this. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   12:57 
OK, OK, so we just match with the name who is the top level officer and his signature like we don't. OK, OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   13:01 
Name. 
Yes, if there is, you know if there is a scenario where you know sign is like we cannot read it, then there is a different way where we can find. I need to open the record of this agent. So what I'll do, I will copy this code. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   13:09 
Mhm. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   13:18 
This is the PCN, you know producer code number which P plus generate a unique identification for them. So I will go to the my C process and I will try to find the paperwork of the Jennifer. So you know basically when we create this record for Jennifer we will we will have a ADS for him. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   13:21 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   13:38 
So I will open the document for it. So in the all work item ID I do not have anything so I will check in archive. We have archive queue here. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   13:46 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   13:47 
I will find in this. 
So I need I will check the appointment one. These are the appointment so I will open the appointment. 
I will open this one. 
And on the authorization tab I will have the sign. 
So you know, this is the way we we can find it or we can validate it as well. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   14:12 
Yeah. 
OK, OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   14:19 
Yeah. 
OK. 
So we have so my paperwork is I go. I have checked all the requirement. I have all the basic require requirement which I need to create the record and sign as valid sign is valid. 
Now the second thing which I need to check is the channel. So basically in the broad market two type, we have two type of channels, one is BJ broker general agencies and the 2nd is F5 financial institutions. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   14:51 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   14:52 
What is the difference between both of them? BJ are the Commission based top levels. So you know whatever they are selling, they will get the Commission, but the financial institutions are the bank employees. 
OK, so they will get the salary for that. You know the agent will get the salaries. So I'm showing the BG one for the FI. We have you know little bit different procedure. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   15:06 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   15:17 
But where I can check which the top level channel I will go to the hierarchy and in the sub channel or channel I can check the BGA. So it's a BG 1. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   15:17 
Yeah. 
OK, for Fi it would be like Fi brokerage Fi. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   15:31 
Uh, it will like financial professional. Let me show you one. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   15:33 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   15:39 
Sufficiency financial institutions. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   15:41 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   15:42 
You got your file. 
Now second thing you know since I am I am in the you know record of top level, I will check the profile as well because you know to create the agent record I need this profile number. 
Active one so I will remember that this has a 001 profile. So since you know it has a two profile, but if you can check the comment live business only so I will use this one. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   15:59 
OK. 
Mhm. 
OK, OK. So you'll check the profile and the level. So the profile should be 001 and the level should be 15. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   16:16 
The level. 
15 or you know if I have a level 13 or 15 in the level 13 or 11 then I have to check the notes of the 15 level based on you know. Based on that I will check the profile and level. So basically you know we have to link this agent hierarchy to the top levels. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   16:31 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   16:37 
And we link based on the levels, so agent if I have a level 11315, so I will link this agent to the level 13, not direct 15 if I have in the hierarchy. 
Based on the levels, for example admission you know type of way it will be easy. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   16:56 
Mhm. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   16:57 
So basically let's suppose I have a agent X which will be on level one. The writing agent should always be on level one. We will create the record on level one and I have a sub office. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   17:04 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   17:09 
Level 13 and the top level 15. So what I'll do, I will link this agent to sub office. 
So what will happen? Agent will directly report to the level 15. You know it will automatically link to the level 15. It will report to level 13, then level 13 will report to level 15 and if I do not have any level 13 in the hierarchy then I will directly link this agent to level 15. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   17:26 
OK. 
OK, OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   17:35 
That's how we create the hierarchy and let's suppose if I have another intermediate. 
We should be on level 6. Then what I have to do? I have to link this agent with intermediate the level 6 and by default the hierarchy will link to level 13 or 15. I'll show when we will create the hierarchy. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   17:58 
Mhm. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   17:59 
OK. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   18:00 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   18:02 
So my paperwork is good to go. I know this is for BJ. Then my next step would be to do the work search. No I have to do the work search and see process itself. Whether you know is there any duplicate request for the agent or is there something any other request which is in our queue? 
I have to do first log search. Let me close it. So how I can do I can do it by name. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   18:20 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   18:29 
Let me check by the agent SSN. 
The agent name is Lawrence. 
So if we can check. 
OK. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   18:47 
Different. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   18:47 
It's a different one, right? 
OK, so this is for agent, so we do not have any other work item ID or any other request for this agent. However, since you know we have office entity case, so I will do the workset via form as well the entity. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   19:07 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   19:10 
Insurance. But if you can see, I'll put the complete name to filter out it. 
So if I can see these are the different one, it has a different SSN, so these are the different. We have only one work item ID. 
On which I am working, so we do not have any duplicate or any other work type for this request. Sometime what happened, you know sometimes we will receive a related work size. There's a work type life map. If we found the life map for the agent in work size, that means there is a new business for him. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   19:33 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   19:48 
So we have to, you know, take the action on that work item ID as well. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   19:54 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   19:55 
OK, so we do not have any. We do not have anything for him. Now we will start our setup. So on DP plus first of all you know I have to create the record for the form. 
Because the office entity case, first of all I have to create the record for entity, so I'll go to this producer tab and click add. 
This tab will open here in this SSN field. I have to put the form SSN, the entities SSN which is this you know because I'm creating the record for entity so I will put the information of entity 4124. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   20:31 
Mhm. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   20:39 
03029. 
29 OK so first I have to click on fetch producer SQL. 
So what is the fetch producer SQL there? So basically in the Pacific lab we have team three markets, broad, affluent and annuities. So the fetch SQL did like SQL find this SSN in other two markets affluent and annuities. 
Systems and if you found any record for this SSN, it will pop up here. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   21:10 
Yeah. 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   21:15 
So there is no matching producer for this form as of. So basically this form is not working with Pacific Life in any of market. 
This is the first time we are getting the record with Pacific live and what is the purpose? Why we are you know, uh finding this uh SSN in other divisions you know to. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   21:24 
Mhm. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   21:35 
To avoid the duplicacy. So basically what happened in the next step what we will do if we have a new business, we will send the appointment request to the state. For that particular state we have to send an appointment request, but if the agent is already working with specific. 
Life in other divisions, it might possible that the agent is already appointed with Pacific life on estate. 
So you know we we need to check that if the agent is already appointed with Pacific Life then we will not send it the you know appointment request again to the state. We will add the appointment but we will not add assign to the state. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   22:02 
OK, OK. 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   22:15 
OK. 
OK now my next step will be the fetch NPN. So the system will fetch the NPN for the form. So if you can see the name is also fetch up fetched and from which system this P plus has fetched it's you know it's linked with this circle. So there's a tool RTDP real time data. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   22:29 
Mm. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   22:38 
Apple. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   22:38 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   22:39 
So there is a third party tool Sarkan which maintain the agent agent licensing appointment and personal information. So people assist link with the Sarkan. So when I click the fetch NPN or fetch producer information, people pull the current information from the Sarkan for that particular SSN SSN. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   22:57 
OK. Uh, so Sarkan is specific lives application or it's a it's a third party tool. OK, OK, OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   22:59 
Third party tool, Third party tool TPM. 
Now I click on the fetch producer information. 
OK, now I will select the PCN type as a standard. So basically Genpact is authorized to, you know, set up the standards agents only, not we are not authorized to create the BG officer, the top level officer, not neither for the top levels. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   23:14 
If. 
So the top level which we just saw in the P plus, so it yeah, it was not done by us, it was done by someone else. OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   23:28 
So yes, the level 15. 
No, it was done by the Pacific Live team. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   23:34 
OK, so we'll always do this standard one, OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   23:37 
The standard one, yes. 
I'll select the standard. Then I have to click on enter. Once I click enter, the system will generate a producer code number for the agent. If you can see the producer code number, a unique producer code is generated for this agent. 
It's, you know it's it's like the OHR for us. So in Genpact, Genpact provide the OHR for us a unique number that's the people has to write the unique number for the agent. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   23:56 
OK. 
Mhm, yeah, yeah. 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   24:08 
Here we have to update few fields. First I have to click on so there are some field API effective date system will automatically populate the API effective date today -1 year. 
We don't need to make any changes in this field system will automatically pull it. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   24:22 
OK. 
Mm-hmm. OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   24:26 
I have to click on. I have verified the SSN. I have to click on this. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   24:31 
So this SSN is for the producer, right? Not for the agent. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   24:34 
It's for the com. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   24:36 
It's oh, OK. It's for the form, OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   24:38 
Yes, we are getting the record for the song first. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   24:41 
OK. So since it was not there with us, that's why, right? OK, OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   24:44 
Yeah. 
So it is not on P plus basically not with the passive type, but it is not on P plus. Therefore we are creating the record on P plus. It might possible you know agent is working at that division. Still we have to create on the record on P plus because agent or firm is not set up on the P plus. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   24:49 
Not on the people, OK. 
OK, OK. 
OK, OK. So first we'll do for form, then we'll do for the agent. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   25:02 
OK. 
Agent, yes. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   25:06 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   25:08 
Now I have to update the ADS signed date. So the ADS signed date it would be on pits authorization page which has level page 8. So this is the declaration authorization page. Then I will update the ADS signed date. 
So I think there is a some exceptions for the ADS signed it. So let's suppose if the pick up page is not signed or the sign is missing on the declaration form or. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   25:30 
Mhm. 
Mhm. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   25:39 
On page 3rd SSN are missing so let me show you. In this page the SSNS are missing and if there is any yes question I will not update the ADA signed it. It will be blank. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   25:54 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   25:55 
I need to leave it as a blank. I cannot. So you know these are the scenario. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   26:02 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   26:03 
Next the CRD. So CRD number is the you know identification number for FINRA. FINRA is a public site for US CRD number for the. If they provide the CID CRD number we can update it. If they didn't provide the we can leave it. 
OK since we are creating this for firm so it will not there firm name. The name is for individual but we are creating the record for firm so it will be here business entity name. There's one thing we need to select the pay name type for firm. So if I am creating the record for individual it will automatically. 
It will pop up as an individual. I need to select as an individual but I am creating the record for a firm so I need to select whether it's firm is a corporate or non incorporate and how I can find it. You know I can find it by the name or if I have a W9 page I need to check and the other page if they provide the. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   26:49 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   26:59 
W9 page. So here you can see W9 page. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   27:03 
Mhm. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   27:05 
So where you know they checked whether it should a corporation or non corporated. So they checked as AC, it's when it's a corporation. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   27:14 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   27:15 
So I have to select as a corporation. 
OK, next is the office. In the office code I have to put the top level code. 
So my top level code would be on the hierarchy page. 
It was B 0028 so I will update the same code here 28. 
And date of word will be the you know blank because form cannot have a date of word. Yeah and here I will have a section of primary preferred address. So on the page. So since I'm creating the record for form, I will pull the information from this section where we have the information for form. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   27:44 
Oh, yeah. OK. OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   28:00 
So this is the business address which we we will update as a primary preferred for him. 
So 225. 
W. 
Uh, RAY. 
Oh. 
What are they? 
OK, so you know the line has a capacity of 30 character. So if the address is crossing the 30 character, what I have to do, I have to update in the second line as well. 
So but there is an you know rule here. If I have to update the address in second line, I have to make sure the street information should be on level 1. So has if they mentioned the number with has it's mean it's a street number. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   28:47 
The. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   29:03 
So what I have to do, I have to remove this from here and I will update this state in first line SD 207. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   29:04 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   29:14 
207. 
That's all I have to update it. 
And in the zip code. 
84117 and my state is UT and my city with. 
Lakes Salt Lake City. 
Add is updated. Now the next section is for pay information. 
So here we have some you know options in drop down check, DSO check, DSO, EFT, electronic funds and NCC. We only work for check and electronic fund. 
So basically if I haven't received the electronic fund information or a electronic fund, you know is not go to to any reason, I will update as a check here. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   30:00 
OK. 
Mm-hmm. 
Do we get this information in the ADS form whether it's? 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   30:11 
Because. 
Electronic fund. This is the information we have to update it here. The direct deposit information, electronic fund information. So you know in this case we have a IGO form so we will update it. But if I do not have this as a IGO or if missing then I will select as a check. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   30:20 
OK. 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   30:33 
But here I will select the electronic font. System method should always be no print. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   30:40 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   30:40 
We will not change it. Payment frequency we will not change. It will by default weekly Friday. 
You know we don't need to make any changes in this step, but one thing if you know I'm selecting the check in first time itself, it will come up as a print. 
Then I have to change it as a no print manually. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   31:00 
OK, OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   31:03 
On the routing number I have to update the information. So routing number is just like I have a C code for India. It should be 9 digit, not more than 9 or not less than 9. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   31:11 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   31:19 
124300107 account number I have to put 511. 
57. 
9/2. 
Give me a moment. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   31:38 
Yeah, sure, sure. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   32:07 
Sorry, 51157928174. 
8174. 
574928174 OK, I will update the same information in the section. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   32:22 
Oh. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   32:29 
You know, uh, this step will automatically mask the account number. Therefore I will be in this section first. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   32:31 
Yeah. OK. OK. 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   32:36 
I have to check click on confirm my account is correctly updated. Now I have to click on navigate. 
This is this is the second tip threading producer ID. In this step we don't need to any you know update or anything so I will navigate it. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   32:53 
Yeah. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   32:54 
Next step would be the contact information. Here I have to add this phone number, fax number and e-mail. 
So I have to click on add number fax number if I have. 
I do have the fax number so I will update the number as 801. 
485485 and 5091. 
I have to click on add to index. You know if I miss to click on add to index it will not add here. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   33:27 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   33:28 
Acto index in the same way I have to update the business number, phone number. 
It's same 4200. 
And in the same way I have to add the e-mail address. So you know we have a multiple e-mail option here where we use the primary paper e-mail. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   33:51 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   33:55 
My e-mail is. 
Right. 
We're a Tirod at the rate. 
That's not which. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   34:11 
Which spelling is wrong? IM it's IMS. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   34:15 
It's IMSP sorry RSPEC dot BIZBIZ add to index then save and navigate. This is the address tab now. So if you can see primary preferred address is already added which we have. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   34:16 
You've written IS. Yeah, IS. 
Yeah. 
Mhm. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   34:35 
I did on the first tab, so it will, you know, automatically populate here. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   34:38 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   34:39 
Now what I have to do? I have to add the business address again. 
You know for that I need to click add an address, then select type of business, type of address and business. I have a fetch option here I can click on that. 
Fudge address. 
Business I will select which one I am looking for. So you know I have click on the business and if the this address is matched with my paperwork I can you know take it and if it is a different then what I have to do I have to. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   35:09 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   35:13 
Uh, update according to the paperwork. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   35:15 
If OK and from where is that pulling the address? This address? OK, I'll OK with the third party tool, OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   35:19 
From Sakan. 
Yes, you know whatever I will fetch on this P plus all information will fetch from this third party tool. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   35:30 
OK, understood. And your source of truth will always be the ADS document that you receive. If there is something mismatch then you will update what is there in the ADS OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   35:35 
ADS document, yes. 
Paper bug. 
So to do 5 the same way I have to update as a Ste. 
But you know it will not allow me. So what I'll do, I will control X and I will update it. 
And then if you can see the city name is different, so I have to make the changes accordingly. 
What's the Salt Lake City? 
Then I have to click on add to index address added and save and navigate. Next step is for Commission schedule where we know we have we have to add the Commission. So you know basically most of the time or you know general Commission percentage is like 10 percent 20%. 
30% right what they will get but for for the passive client what they do you know they have created some buckets for the Commission. So they have created the Commission in the you know they have commissioned as a PL00PL01PL02 say like a PL07. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   36:34 
Mhm. 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   36:54 
So the this one is a non pay Commission where agent will not get any Commission. Apply not top level will get all the Commission and if they are on the PL01 to PL06 then you know agent will get the Commission and if the request is of PL0 PL07 Genpact is not authorized to work on that we have to. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   37:13 
Mm. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   37:13 
Escalate the case to onshore team. This is the Max level Commission request, so we are not authorized to process this. It has a separate procedure. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   37:15 
OK, OK. 
OK, mm-hmm. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   37:22 
So I will update add the commission schedule based on the request. So on the our paperwork commission schedule is PL06 so I will add it the same way. What I have to do I have to click on add to add contract, add contract. Then I will select the contract here PL06. I don't need to make any changes in the date and anything. 
Yeah, simply I need to select the Commission type, then I will add add to index. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   37:42 
Mhm, OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   37:47 
Commission added then save and navigate. The next step is for hierarchy where I have to create the hierarchy for this form. 
So you know that, uh, good, sorry. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   37:59 
OK. 
But so this will be the top level, right? Level one and 15. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   38:07 
No, basically we are creating the record for form and the form levels are decided as a level 6. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   38:07 
Oh, no. 
OK. 
OK, OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   38:14 
So we have to create a profile on level 6 and you know to the to whom and it will report it here it will report to the top level. So how we create basically we'll click add an agreement profile. So our profile start with 001. So basically this is the sequence number for the profile which is start 00123. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   38:33 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   38:33 
On the you know sequence of the hierarchy. So basically we are creating the first so it will be 001 level levels are already decided here. So for the individual level is one for the firm or entity it level 6 and the for top level are level 15. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   38:51 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   38:51 
OK, so we are getting the level form, so we will use level 6 here. 
Commission will be automatically, you know added here in the drop down which we have added in the previous step which is PL06. 
Yeah. 
Here effective date will automatically pop up currently -1 year. I didn't. I don't need to make any changes in this date if I'm creating a new record. 
Superior ID would be the code to whom this agent or firm will report. So based on the hierarchy to whom my firm will report, it will report to P 0028. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   39:28 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   39:29 
I will add the as PW28 and the profile which you know remember we check when we are checking the top level record we check the profile as a 001. So I will take as a 001 because this top level has a 001 profile. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   39:39 
001, yeah. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   39:46 
Uh down I will click on add to index. 
Oh, pop up is work blocks. No, it will not show you. 
That RK has been created. 
OK, pop up is not open. I'll show you how they hierarchy grade once we complete the record. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   40:09 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   40:10 
Now what I have to do? I have to click save and navigate. 
Oh, sorry, what? Because I have selected it, so I need to select it to. So the navigate to the next step is the license tab. Here what I have to do, I have to click on fetch license. 
And the P plus will fetch all the license which has the entity currently active license for the entity form. So it has only one state license Otaha which is an active status. OK and in the same way we have to check Ajay here the requested state license and the residence state license. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   40:48 
Yeah. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   40:55 
So basically in our remember in when we are the genius policy, we need to check the license for the policy state and the residency state. So in the same way we have to check here as well. So in our case you know that the residence and requested is still the same so it entity has the license. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   40:57 
Mhm. 
The resident. Yeah, yes, yes. 
Yeah, OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   41:11 
So it's a good to go and also it has a life life a mandate 1. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   41:17 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   41:18 
Save and navigate. 
Now this tab is for appointment. 
So. 
Appointment. If you remember we discussed about the appointment categories. In the US the states are divided into 4 categories, Windows, three state and you know RIST state and non appointment state. 
So pre states are the state which required you know pre appointment before selling a business they need the appointment. These are the two state Pennsylvania and Montana. So basically what they say if you want to sell business in Pennsylvania you need to take the appointment with the career company with before selling any business. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   41:43 
Yeah. 
Mm-hmm. OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   42:03 
You know, so if we received any request for pre state, what we do, we add the appointment, we send the request to the state. 
Directly but opposite to the window state like window state provide a window period. So what they say like you can save the business in our state and you have a window period in between you can get the appointment. You can you know take the appointment with career company in that particular time period. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   42:33 
OK, OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   42:35 
OK so you Otaha is the window state. So for the you know window states what Pacific life follow Pacific life ask for the business first. So basically what we do if I receive the request for window state I will check the like if the agent said any new business if agent. 
Sale any new business then we I will add the appointment. I will send the request to state. If agent didn't sell any business yet then I will not the appointment because you know the each appointment has a fee. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   43:02 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   43:06 
Which Pacific has to pay and if they didn't sell any business, then you know there is no profit for Pacific life to, you know, pay the fees. Therefore Pacific hold the appointment. Once they sell the business, we will add the appointment or we will, you know, send the appointment request to restate and we'll pay the fee. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   43:07 
OK. 
OK, so you remembered all the states by heart or you like it? 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   43:28 
OK, yeah, we have a tool for that. Let me show you. Sorry that I know I meant to just. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   43:32 
Yeah, yeah. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   43:35 
So this is the open text where we have all our SOPs and tools. So there is a tool here, Pl. processing tool. I'll open it. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   43:38 
Mhm. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   43:50 
We have seen this in the Genius Uh walkthrough as well. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   43:52 
Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   43:59 
So this is the Excel file, you know. So we call basically we called it, you know, a state guide, uh, guidebook. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   44:08 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   44:08 
Name is Pl. processing. Generally we call the state guideline. We know because this Excel has a each information for that particular state, which type of license they provide, which line of authority they provide, you know which line of authority they you know. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   44:17 
Mhm. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   44:24 
They give authority to take the appointment and these are the some other conditions. And here if you can see registry state no. So this is not the registry state pre state no this is not the pre state. In this section I can find you know in which category states false. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   44:41 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   44:41 
So if I go to the here appointment grace period, if any state has a grace appointment period, it means it's following the window category. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   44:48 
OK, OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   44:49 
So I'll check with Otaha for UT. You know I have to put the abbreviation here. It will show the information. So if you can see it will has a window period here 15 days. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   44:57 
Mhm. 
15 days, OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   45:03 
So that's how we check the category. OK, so you know it falls under window state, so I'm not going to appoint him as of now because he didn't sell it. I you know, I perform the work search, I do not have any new business for him and on the paperwork they didn't mark any information, you know. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   45:04 
OK. OK. Understood. Yeah. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   45:23 
Mentioned any information related to new business. Sometime what they do you know they mentioned on the paperwork like agent is going to sell a business or agent as a client name this or agent as a NB in house. You know they indicate some kind of information in the cover page. If they mentioned then we will. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   45:31 
Mhm. 
In that case, we can we send the appointment. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   45:40 
Yes, we sent the appointment and how we send let me show you. So basically in the state appointment I will select the state in which I want to send the appointment Otaha action. I need to select all LOA. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   45:41 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   45:55 
Appointment type. It's a form. Then I have to select the business entity and if I'm adding the appointment for individual I have to select individual one. 
So business entity then in this section is state company, PLIC, Pacific Life Insurance Company here effective date it will you know automatically pop it by to current date. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   46:04 
OK. 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   46:19 
OK, then the state indicator. Yes, it's mean the request will, you know, go to the state. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   46:26 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   46:26 
OK, what I have to do, I have to click on process and this request will send to the state. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   46:32 
No, it will not do it now, right. OK. OK. Yeah. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   46:34 
No, we are not doing it because we are not sending it. And one more thing Ajay here the SQL one part will you know comes in picture in this tab itself. If this agent or form is already set up in a different market, the SQL shows that the you know agent is or form is active in this market then what we have to do. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   46:47 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   46:54 
Before sending this to state, I have to go to this. I have to go to the state website for Otaha and I have to double check the agent is already appointed with Pacific Life or not. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   46:57 
Uh. 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   47:09 
OK, if the agent is showing already appointed with Pacific Live then what I'll do I will change just to no and I will update the date based on the state website. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   47:20 
OK. When when he was appointed, when he was previously appointed. OK, OK, OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   47:21 
That's how I will add the appointment. Yes, when he's already appointed on the state by. 
OK, so since in this case you know neither we are going to add the appointment, neither that form was already working with Pacific Life in other divisions, so we are not adding anything here. 
OK, I will remove this information. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   47:39 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   47:46 
And seven navigate. This tab is for training anti money laundering training. If they provided the training we will add it. In this case they provided. So I'll go to this page anti money laundering.

The top level and if you know if there is a level 13 or any other level then it will show you in the between. Then I have to you know in the superior one. Let me one will create the agent one. I'll show you how this will show so the entities record created. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   50:02 
OK. 
Yeah. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   50:11 
OK, now what I'll do, I will copy this. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   50:11 
Yeah. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   50:16 
Code and I'll go my work item ID or in this section producer code. I have to update the producer code which I have created. Click on populate. The C process is also linked with P plus. So when I update the producer code and click on populated the name name is you know populated from P plus. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   50:34 
OK. 
OK. 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   50:50 
There is no new business so I will uncheck this since we do not have any business. Now you know I will add the comment but before comment I will create the record for agent then we will complete this case. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   51:01 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   51:02 
So now in the same way, yeah, in the same way I have to create the record for agent. First of all I'll double check you know agent should not be on P plus already not on P plus. So what I'll do I will find by the SSN 5 to 6. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   51:04 
Again, we go to P plus, yeah. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   51:19 
4/1. 
6415. 
Agent not on file. So sometime what happened, you know sometime we will find the existing record for this agent on P plus then in that case what what we have to do, we have to you know do the cross validation according to our paperwork and if there is any change we have to make the changes and if there is no hierarchy change then we have to do. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   51:35 
Mhm. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   51:46 
It as well. 
It have a it has a different procedure and sometime you know if the top level is different like I found the record but the top level code is a different for that agent then what I have to do I have to create a new record with my new top level. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   51:48 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   52:02 
This is for BGA, so we will start a new record. I'll copy this SSN so I don't need to put it type it manually. Same way I have to put SSN then I'll click on fetch SQL. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   52:02 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   52:19 
So the agent is not working in any market of Pacific Life. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   52:23 
Mm-hmm. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   52:25 
Then last name, last name of the agent. 
Larsen I I can put complete name or I'll go with this as well. Fetch NPN system I fetch the NPN means the SSN is correct. You know if the system are not fetching the NPN it's mean either the SSN is incorrect. 
Or is there is or you know is there in a system issue? 

 
Sharma, Ajay   52:47 
OK. 
So we'll cross check this NPN from whatever there is written on the document ADS. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   52:52 
OK. 
We can, but you know if the end pen is different then we can you know we will take the fetch one. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   52:59 
OK. 
OK, OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   53:06 
Now I'll click the fetch information, but yes I will check the you know, double check the name. So Brett D Larson and one more thing you know if let's suppose the middle name is not on paperwork but system has generated the middle name, I will take the middle name. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   53:13 
Mm. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   53:23 
I will not remove it and if paperwork has a middle name but the system is not pulling it, I will not update the middle name. I will go with the system one. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   53:24 
OK. 
OK, so whatever there is on circle will take will take OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   53:33 
They are fetching. Yes, the name will this one. The NPN and name PCN type should be the standard one. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   53:38 
Um. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   53:42 
Enter. 
Uh, new side code has been generated. OK. 
There is a, you know, a drawback. I can say drawback or something like with this system. You know if I before the address save drive, you know if I open a another record, this record will be, you know, disabled. I will not able to find this record. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   54:10 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   54:11 
OK, so you know before closing this record I have to make sure you know I have set up this record till the address tab. 
Sometimes no, sometimes happen like I need to do on another task. If there is something high priority and then I have to make sure that I have updated the information with the L trust tab. I'll see no, the record will wipe out. I won't be able to find it. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   54:21 
OK. 
Mhm, mhm. 
So this producer ID which is generated, it will be assigned to someone else and a new producer ID will be no. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   54:40 
No, no, it will. You know, I have to use it manually. It will, you know, wastage of the producer code. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   54:44 
OK, OK. 
OK, OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   54:48 
Yeah. 
I have to pretty AD assigned it in the same way it was 2/2. 
2026222026 then CRD if I have on the paperwork. 
We do not have CRD. We will leave it. 
Name is already there. I don't need to make any changes. PCN type here you can see it will come as individual only, so I will select as individual. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   55:20 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   55:20 
Office code would be the top level code always. 
0028 to whom they are reporting. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   55:27 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   55:29 
And then the pane for me primary preferred information. So here you can see we have two address for him, the residence and business. Which one we will take the primary is depend on this section which one they marked as a primary preferred. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   55:44 
OK. Preferred, preferred, OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   55:45 
So they marked as a business. If they marked as a residence then I will update the residence as a primary preferred and if they you know didn't marked any section then I will take a business as a primary preferred. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   55:57 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   55:59 
OK, so 225. 
Road and the same way it will not allow me in the first line, so I'll put it in a second line ST207. 
Yep. 
84117. 
5 tonight though. 
And city is shooting. 
And my setting up is. 
All day. 
Then then here this is the pay information. So in for these this request we have the EFT for entity not for the agent so that this SSN was for form not for the agent. So we will not add this EFT for the agent. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   57:07 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   57:09 
So I will select as a check here. 
As you can see, it's come as an print, so I have to manually make it change the no print. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   57:16 
Mhm. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   57:22 
Then I will click on navigate. 
This is second tab on which we will not work. Then again navigate. 
Where on the same way I have to update the contact information for agent.

Next then seven navigate. 
Here I have to add the residence address for this agent. 
Click on Address Residence. 
I can use the fetch address option. 
I like the residence. If this is the same one, I can use it. 
To do one welcome a swag gun holiday. 
Welcome video. 
It is the same one, so I'll click on set address. 
And I will click on to index. 
There is a exception here Azure. Let's suppose if they marked as a residence, the residence as a primary preferred, then what I'll do, I will add this as a primary preferred in the first step. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   59:28 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   59:29 
Then I'll go to. Once I come in this step then I will have to you know re add the residence address in the residence tab. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   59:37 
OK. So both the places, the residence address will will be there, OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   59:41 
Address. Yep. And then I will add a third address as a business address, which is will be the different one. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   59:46 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   59:47 
Then I in this case I have to add 3 address step there. OK. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   59:51 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   59:53 
Save and navigate Commission tab. So in the officer entity case the agent the individual will always be on PL00 so he will not get any Commission. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:00:08 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:00:09 
OK add to index. I'll by default take it as a PL00 add to index save and navigate. Here I have to create the hierarchies so add agreement to file will be 001. 
Level 01. 
Commission which I have added as a PL00 here the superior ID I will take for the form one which I have generated previously. In this case agent will report their own form, so this is the one. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:00:36 
Yeah. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:00:43 
And that profile which we have created as a 001 for this record. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:00:49 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:00:49 
So I'll click on it to index and if you can see now agent will report to their own firm and the firm will report to the top level. 
That's how we. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:01:00 
OK, OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:01:06 
And the in this case we have to create 2 hierarchies. So this is you know this was for individual. Now the agent you know agent is the owner of their own firm. So we have to create a 0 to profile level would be the five. 
Commission same applying and profile. 
And I will add a comment here agreement to use for officer of this code. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:01:37 
Could you please repeat like why are we adding this second profile? 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:01:40 
So basically you know whenever we are receiving office entity case, we have to create a two profiles one. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:01:46 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:01:48 
One is for you know the individual on which profile they will you know fail the business and the second business for as a officer of their own firm. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:01:57 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:02:00 
Add to index. 
Now you can see officer it will also report to the firm and then top level. 
And then save and navigate. 
For the license, fetch license. 
Now the agent has multiple license. What we have to choose check. We have to check the Otaha one. 
So I is the residence as well, so it has a active and Y indicator. 
Slices file is good to go. Now I'll go to the appointment one since the agent does not have any new business, so I'm not going to add any appointment for him. I'll escape this one as well. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:02:37 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:02:50 
So we navigate and this is step for AML, so I will add the training in the same way. 
Other career and the date was.

Add to index and save and navigate. 
Record has been created for this agent. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:03:24

Yes, in both records. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:03:34

Varshney, Gopesh   1:04:05 
Here you know I have to add a note for entity. So basically what we do for office entity case we give we give the reference for each other of each other. 
You know, currently I'm working on this request, so I know this is the office and this is the entity, right? But someone other you know when someone other will receive any policy for this agent in genius, he will not be able to find out who is the entity for this agent and who is the officer for this agent. So what we do? 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:04:15

OK. 
OK, we. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:06:23 
Now what we have to do, we have to close this request which we have received. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:06:29 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:06:31 
So you know since we have created 2 records So what we need we need we need two work item ID so we need to request for them. So what I'll do I'll create this clone this one you know I will create duplicate one for officer. 
I will clone it. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:06:44

Varshney, Gopesh   1:08:41 
So the Segal is also linked with P plus. So what will Segal will do? Segal will fetch this code information based on this hierarchy.

Varshney, Gopesh   1:09:40 
And continue. Then I'll get the CC option. 
Here I will add this top level. 
Continue in BCC. We are not going to add anyone. 
So I'll leave it as a blank. 
OK. 
OK, so in the for the BGA type of top levels in the welcome letter we have to you know attach some document standard attachment. I have to attach producer agreement. This agreement will have all the you know agreement between the Pacific life and the agent. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:10:10 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:10:18 
With the date so I will click on add attachment and the compensation schedule. This document will have all the information regarding the Commission, how they will get, you know what Commission and on which time they will get. So I have to attest this document here. 
Continue. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:10:38 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:10:43 
All Commission paid, you know if the agent is on paying contract, basically if there is on PL0123456 then I will leave it as a blank because all Commission by default go to the form entity itself. I'll leave it as a. 
It is a blank notification is my first notification free form. I will leave it as a blank continue. 
Preview e-mail. 
The letter has been created so basically it it is sending from the this e-mail box not in from our e-mail box to and CC subject line would be there and these are the two attachment. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:11:27 
OK, OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:11:33 
And here's the his no name code and the state. You know if I added any appointment it will automatically come up here. But as we haven't added any appointment it is showing as a jet just in time jet OK and if you can see the system has in it, you know by default populated the apply name. Immediate apply is the top level. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:11:36 
OK, OK. 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:11:53 
I group parency. OK, now I will submit it and send. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:11:55

Varshney, Gopesh   1:12:01 
So the letter is sent. I'll go to the entities record work item ID. I will add a comment like entity. 
Has been set up on P plus and welcome letter sent. That's all I have to add and you know if I have added any appointment then I'll add that in comment as well like appointed in this set and welcome sent. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:12:25 
Mhm. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:12:28 
But I'll complete it. The entities one is completed. Now I'll in the same way I will send a letter for officer, the agent. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:12:37 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:12:38 
Back to home. 
This and work item ID in which we are doing for officer. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:12:48 
This is the one that you cloned, right? 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:12:49 
And yes. 
Search. 
OK, continue. 
Then welcome. 
Continue so in the two I will add the agent e-mail address because we are so since the form and agent has the same e-mail address it is showing as a one and six. Both are the same e-mail address. If the form and agent has a different e-mail address it will show as a three e-mail address 1615. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:13:18 
Mhm. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:13:23 
So for the agent I will select one and two. 
And in CCI will at the top level then continue. 
Continue in the same way I have I have to attach the producer argument for this letter as well. 
At attachment. But you know in this case agent is on PL00 right? Agent will not get any Commission so I'm not going to provide this document. You know if I provide this it will you know it will agent will got confused. You know why if I'm not getting any Commission why I'm getting this? 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:13:54 
Yeah, OK. 
OK. 
Confusion. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:14:04 
I'm not adding it continue. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:14:05 
Mhm. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:14:11 
Here since agent is not getting any Commission then we have to select to whom the Commission will paid. So the Commission will paid to the immediate applying of this agent. So to whom he the agent is reporting. Yeah notification will go 1st and continue. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:14:22 
Insurance marketing, yeah, yeah. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:14:42 
In the same way that has been created for him. Now in that section we have two information like all immediate applying and all Commission paid. 
And some bit. 
And uh, letter sent. I will add the same comment. 
But instead of entity, I will use the word as a agent. 
That's how we have to add and complete. So now the request has been completed. 
So this is the one Ajay which is the IGO. We have you know multiple scenarios in this as well. To be very honest, we have multiple scenarios where you know that some information is missing or there's a hierarchy change request or the distribution is not a BG or AFI. So we have to take the action accordingly. This is the one which you know which we have received IGO. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:15:14 
OK. 
Right. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:15:32 
Complete IO. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:15:32 
OK, OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:15:34 
And one more thing, I want to let you know that you know in this section you can see there's you know data entry, whatever we are receiving on paperwork, we have to update on the system similar right? There is no rules. So the Pacific Live has already implemented automation for that. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:15:45 
Yeah. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:15:52 
Which we are receiving as a auto ADS in RQ. So basically in the auto radius what happened system are automatically creating a record on P plus what we have to do, we have to you know take the action on the fields which required manual interpretation or which required some logics. 
Like the hierarchy required some logic so system is not creating the hierarchy. The AD assigned it is depend on these you know scenario whether something missing or not. It's so you know decision make fails. So there are five fails on system is not updated. However the other records the system is creating. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:16:12 
OK, OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:16:26 
But yes, it's not implemented for all of them. There is only one vendor, sure LC vendor. You know whenever we are receiving a request from a sure LC vendor, the system is automatically creating a record for them and we receive the request as a auto ADS where you know we have to take the action on some fields only. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:16:36 
Mhm. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:16:44 
Not on all. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:16:45 
OK. And and how much percentage of that we are getting auto ADS 1? 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:16:50 
So basically auto ADS if I say we are receiving this is the time we have a low volume but generally we receive the auto ADS to 800 to 900 and the appointment is like 100 to 5900. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:17:04 
OK. 

 
Varshney, Gopesh   1:17:05 
Sorry, not under thousand to 1000 to 1500 or 800 to 900. 

 
Sharma, Ajay   1:17:10
