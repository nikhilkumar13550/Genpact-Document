Yeah, or if.
Yeah, if like for example we're going to search the policy and then the account screen, there will be like there they will list all the active accounts that they have there. Also the how many classes that they have on a specific account. So right like.
Those ones. So we'll have to choose what are the active accounts and then we're just going to put it in here. Like for for this sample file they only have one account which is 001 and then for classes they only have Class A and Class B.
Like some such of those categories.
